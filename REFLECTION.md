I used to push on github via VSCode, and this is the first time using command with git. 

I learned how to push push code to GitHub using the command lineã€‚
The most frustrating part for me is typing perhaps. I used to copy-paste long addresses and in command line I have to type it letter by letter.
Git is great for tracking changes and versions, and allows me to roll back if needed. It provides a platform for collaborations for large projects.
